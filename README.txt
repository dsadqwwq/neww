Duel PVP — Final Site (v5)

- FIX: Brand text layered above everything (no disappearing).
- COORDINATED SLOW GLOW stays (4s cycle).
- NEW: Live glow alignment in debug mode.
  Use `?debug=1` to show a draggable dot. Drag or use arrow keys to position the glow on the rock crack.
  You can also pass URL params to save positions: ?gx=72&gy=58&gw=264px&gh=458px
- Logo pinned top-left; brand block bottom-center. Blinking dot after 'arena' intact.

Deploy as static to Vercel. Replace assets/logo-pvp.png with a transparent PNG for perfect edges.
