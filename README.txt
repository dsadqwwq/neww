Duel PVP — Final Site (v7)

- Glow moved up and right (x=82%, y=36%) to hit upper crystal area; slower 6s pulse.
- DUEL PVP stays static; only the slogan glows with super-white sunlight effect.
- Keep debug controls: add ?debug=1 to drag the glow or use arrow keys.
- You can also test with URL params: ?gx=82&gy=36&gw=264px&gh=458px
